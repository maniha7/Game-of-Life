# Conway's Game of Life
Utilizing Pygame, this program runs a Conway's Game of Life cellular automata with extensive user control. Users draw the the active starting cells on the screen and start the automata with the spacebar. Users may undo changes they've made during the drawing process, and can pause mid-animation and draw additional cells, before continuing the animation of the cells' evolution. After the animation, users may clear the screen or reset the drawing they just simulated. Users can also control animation speed, as well as paste in specific preset shapes with interesting evolutions.
